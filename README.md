# LockyBox

The purpose of this project is to build a box to protect various items safely by the owner. It can be used to store important documents such as property deeds, business contracts, identity cards, passports or other personal documents. Also, another role of the safe is to keep valuables such as jewelry, money, coins or other valuables.
It is desired to make a safe with a lock, and in order to open it, an RFID card needs to be scanned and a correct access code must be entered by means of potentiometers. The idea of ​​making this project came as a result of a personal need to keep my valuables safe when I'm away on vacation. For this reason I find it useful, both for myself and for other people who want to store various things in certainty.
